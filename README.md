# SMIT-JS-TASK
Overview
This is a simple task that requires you to write some JavaScript code to perform a specific task. The task involves creating a function that takes an array of numbers as input, and returns the sum of all the odd numbers in the array.
hello-world.js: A simple program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.
addition.js: A program that adds two numbers together and prints the result to the console.
palindrome.js: A program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
fizzbuzz.js: A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz"
